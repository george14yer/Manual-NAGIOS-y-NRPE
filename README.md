<h3>How to install Nagios on Ubuntu 20.04</h3>

### Abstract (Resumen)


Nagios is a prominent open source tool that provides network monitoring capabilities. This system is essential for monitoring routers, servers, applications and services, ensuring that they are operating optimally. In case of failures, Nagios sends notification alerts through various methods to prevent further damage. In addition, it offers visual representations and reports that make it easy to understand monitoring results.

The Nagios architecture is based on a main server that hosts the Nagios core, which uses plugins to interact with remote hosts. These hosts, in turn, have an agent such as NRPE installed to allow communication with the main server.
